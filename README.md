# Text-Mining
Text mining is the process of transforming unstructured text into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new insights. By applying advanced analytical techniques, such as Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and other deep learning algorithms, we are able to explore and discover hidden relationships within their unstructured data.
